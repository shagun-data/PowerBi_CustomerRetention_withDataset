# PowerBi_CustomerRetention_withDataset
Define proper KPIs Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management![Image3_churn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d62f4a-f642-49ff-8ac0-de87f7f5bd83)
